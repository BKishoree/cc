# CronIQ — Dead Cron Job & Scheduler Watchdog

**CronIQ** is a SaaS platform that ensures your scheduled jobs actually run — and lets you know when they don't.

> ⏰ Never let a silent cron job failure go unnoticed again.

## 🧠 Problem Solved

Whether you're using traditional cron jobs, Kubernetes CronJobs, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or other CI/CD systems — jobs silently fail all the time. Without built-in observability, these failures go undetected until it's too late.

**CronIQ** helps by monitoring job executions and alerting you if something is late, failed, or unexpectedly skipped.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Simple Ping-Based Monitoring**: Add a single HTTP ping to your job to track success.
- 🔗 **Integrates With Popular Schedulers**: Cron, Kubernetes, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and more.
- 🧠 **Smart Scheduler Awareness**: Detects job frequency and expected run times.
- 📬 **Real-Time Alerts**: Slack, Email, PagerDuty, or custom webhooks.
- 📊 **Dashboard**: View job statuses, history, and missed runs.
- 🔒 **Team Access Control**: Invite team members, assign roles, and restrict views.
